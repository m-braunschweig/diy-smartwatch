# A Diy-Smartwatch using the Atmega-1284P/644P (WIP)
This project aims to make a DIY-Smartwatch. It uses a ``MIC5205`` for power regulation, a ``MPR121`` for Touch-Electrodes, a ``HM-11`` for a Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) connection, a ``BME280`` for
Temperature, Humidity and Pressure, a ``TP4056`` as charging-circuit and as Microcontroller a Atmega-1284P or 644P. The Display is a more or less generic 128x64px OLED-Display, connected with I2C.

**Please note that this Project is still Work in Progress and is not nearly finished yet**

This project originates from this [project](https://github.com/RatsgymnasiumPeine/2016-07-diy-smartwatch), but it's completly rewritten and on a PCB.
